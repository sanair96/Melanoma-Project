## General Information
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
- The final CNN model achieved ~83% validation accuracy, demonstrating effective melanoma classification capabilities
- Data augmentation techniques (rotation, zoom, flip, brightness and contrast adjustment) significantly improved model performance
- Training for 30 epochs showed optimal results, with diminishing returns and signs of overfitting in later epochs
- Dropout layers (0.2-0.5) effectively reduced overfitting while maintaining model learning capacity

## Technologies Used
- TensorFlow - version 2.x
- Keras - version 2.x
- NumPy - version 1.x
- Matplotlib - version 3.x
- scikit-learn - version 1.x
